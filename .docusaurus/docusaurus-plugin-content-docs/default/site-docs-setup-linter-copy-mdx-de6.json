  "description": "Although not mandatory, it is highly recommended to add a linter to your React Native project. Doing so not only helps to ensure a consistent code style throughout the project, but it also identifies errors and uncovers bad practices. Whether it's a personal or hobby project, I always set up linting and code formatting from the beginning when starting a new project.",
