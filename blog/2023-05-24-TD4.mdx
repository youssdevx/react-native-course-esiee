# TD n°4 - Forms & Context

### Setup

1. Create a new Expo project
2. Install eslint and prettier
3. Run the app on your phone
4. Try to run your app on a simulator

### Exercise 1 : Forms and Validation
Objective: To understand and implement forms with validation in React Native with Expo. You'll be creating a form with several fields and their respective validations.

Requirements: Familiarity with JavaScript, React Native, Expo, and basic understanding of form handling and validation in React.

Task
Create a React Native application with Expo. The application should contain a form with the following fields:

- Name - Text input (required, should contain only characters)
- Date of Birth - Date picker (required, should not be a future date)
- Age - This field should be automatically calculated based on the Date of Birth input - Should be a text or a disabled input
- Number of Pets - A number input field (should contain only digits) - Optional
- I'm a great React Native developer (Yes/No) - Implement this using a Switch component
- I understand the rules of the project and I'll do my best - Implement this using a Checkbox component - This should be checked before the form can be submitted

Add a button at the bottom of the screen. The button should be disabled if the required information is not provided.

On submit, the info should be displayed through an ```Alert``` component.

### Exercise 2 : Context

You will add a feature to persist the form data in local storage and pre-fill the form fields when the application is opened again.

Create a new screen called ```DetailsScreen```. On submit of the form, you should navigate to this new screen and, without passing route parameters, display the info of the form.
