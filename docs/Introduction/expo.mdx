[Expo](https://expo.io/) is a suite of tools for React Native that improves the developer experience. 

Some people have strong opinions on whether or not to use it, personnally I hated it and now I love it. If you're new to mobile development and want to start coding quickly, Expo is a good choice. 

It's also a good choice if you have a Windows or Linux machine and want to run your app on your iPhone. With plain React Native, you need a macOS machine to build native iOS apps. 

Expo allows you to install a native "shell" app on your phone and transfer your JavaScript code directly to it, so you don't need to compile anything natively. 

Setting up your development environment without Expo can be time-consuming, as you'll need to download, install, and configure XCode and/or Android Studio. Roughly speaking, it can take a while.

#### macOS

- Expo on physical device: ~10 minutes (Android or iOS)
- Expo on iOS simulator: ~1 hour
- Expo on Android emulator: ~1.5 hours
- Plain React Native on physical device: ~2 hours (Android or iOS)
- Plain React Native on iOS simulator: ~2 hours
- Plain React Native on Android emulator: ~2 hours

#### Windows or Linux

- Expo on physical device: ~20 minutes (Android or iOS)
- Expo on iOS simulator: ❌
- Expo on Android emulator: ~2 hours
- Plain React Native on physical device: ~2.5 hours (Android only)
- Plain React Native on iOS simulator: ❌
- Plain React Native on Android emulator: ~3 hours

Expo's limitations become more noticeable when you're working on advanced projects with React Native. Specifically, if you need to make specific changes to the native code, such as installing libraries or modifying non-JavaScript code and configurations, you'll have to eject from the Expo environment and manage all the native code yourself, as you would with plain React Native.

Expo is an excellent option for developers as it offers a suite of tools that streamline the development process and help developers to create mobile apps in a faster and more efficient way. Although it has some minor limitations, Expo is a great choice for those who want to get started with React Native quickly and without having to deal with complex configurations.
