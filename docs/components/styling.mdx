In React Native, all styling is done using inline styles. We use a `StyleSheet` from `react-native` to create the styles. Usually we add this styles constant at the bottom of the file, or in a separate file:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

React Native styles are actually very similar to css styles on the web. The debugger also displays helpful error messages when you try to add styles that don't exist on a particular component type.

`StyleSheet.create` creates an optimized style object where you can access the individual styles like on a regular object. In this case, `styles.container` would give you all the container styles. Now we can use this style prop inside our JSX by passing it into the relevant element:

```js
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
</View>
```

This is pretty similar to the styles on the web, only we omit the units (`px`, `em`, `rem` etc), because all dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.

Adding a background colour for the component while your debugging can help understand positioning. We could add a background color using the `backgroundColor` property:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: 'lavender',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

Note that all the web colors will work here, but we can also use hex `#ffffff` or rgb `rgb(255,255,255)` or rgba `rgba(255,0,0,0.3)`.

Notice that the style names in React Native are in camelCase instead of kebab-case, but otherwise are the same as the web!

The style properties you can use depend on the component you're trying to style, and fall into 3 categories:

- [View style props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props)
- [Text style props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props)
- [Image style props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image-style-props)

There are some special properties you might not have seen on the web. For instance, you will frequently find yourself applying the same padding or margin. There is a shorthand for it on the web where you can do `margin: 10, 20`, but this won't fly here, since we use number, not strings. Instead, we can set the styles to be `horizontal` or `vertical`. So instead of writing this:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    paddingLeft: 10,
    paddingRight: 10,
    marginTop: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});
```

We can write this:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    paddingHorizontal: 10,
    marginVertical: 20,
  },
});
```

## Positioning

In React Native, all positioning is done using FlexBox and all elements have `display: flex` applied by default. If you've not used flex much before it may seem a bit daunting, but the basics are not too tricky to grasp. If you have time, [FlexBox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) is a fun little game that introduce you to the flex iteratively while you move frogs around the pond. For everyday reference [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) from CSS Tricks is pretty handy.

Suppose we wanted to center all content in a container horizontally. For this, we can use `alignItems: 'center`:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
```

To center all content in a container vertically, we can use `justifyContent: 'center'`. We'll also have to use `flex: 1` to ensure the component takes up the whole height of the screen. If the component is nested inside another component, you'll have to make sure the other component also has `flex: 1`:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

## Styles without StyleSheet

You should always aim to write your styles in a StyleSheet, but sometimes it's not possible or just sub-optimal. For example if you had to add styles dynamically. In this case, we can pass styles into the component as plain objects like so:

```js
<View style={{ backgroundColor: 'teal' }} />
```

Notice the double braces? The first set of braces is to tell JSX we're passing in an object and the second is for the actual object. This is equivalent:

```js
const componentStyle = { backgroundColor: 'teal' };

<View style={componentStyle} />;
```

## Multiple styles in one component

Sometimes you may want to add multiple style objects to one element. You can do this by passing in an _array_ of styles instead of a single style like so:

```js
<View style={[styles.firstStyle, styles.secondStyle]} />
```

The styles cascade as they would on the web, so the later styles would override the former if there are any repeats.

You can also mix `StyleSheet` styles and object styles:

```js
<View style={[styles.firstStyle, { backgroundColor: 'teal' }]} />
```

## Side note: Styling libraries

There are several styling libraries you can use to style components like <b>Styled Components</b>

For example, to style a View, you'll have to do:

```js
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

const StyledView = styled.View`
  background-color: lavender;
`;
```

You also can use my favorite, which is [Restyle](https://shopify.github.io/restyle/fundamentals/)

For this workshop, we will use `StyleSheet`, but feel free to explore this in your own time. Read more about it [here](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native).
