## Install React Navigation dependencies

Install the necessary packages for React Navigation.

Follow these guides 

=> https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started
=> https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation

This will install the core dependencies required for React Navigation to work with Expo.

## Configure navigation
Create a new directory called "navigation" inside the "src" folder of your project. Inside the "navigation" directory, create a new file called "AppNavigator.js". Open the file and add the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

import HomeScreen from '../screens/HomeScreen';
import DetailsScreen from '../screens/DetailsScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const AppNavigator = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default AppNavigator;
```

In this example, we create a basic navigation structure with two screens: "Home" and "Details". You can replace these screens with your own screen components.

## Create screen components
Create two new files inside the "src/screens" directory: "HomeScreen.js" and "DetailsScreen.js". In each file, add a basic React component, like this:

HomeScreen.js:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to the Home Screen!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

DetailsScreen.js:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const DetailsScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to the Details Screen!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default DetailsScreen;
```

## Update App.js
Open the "App.js" file in the root of your project and replace the existing code with the following:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import AppNavigator from './src/navigation/AppNavigator';

const App = () => {
  return <AppNavigator />;
};

export default App;
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You have successfully added navigation to your Expo project using React Navigation. You can now customize and expand your navigation structure by adding more screens and configuring navigation options. Happy coding!
