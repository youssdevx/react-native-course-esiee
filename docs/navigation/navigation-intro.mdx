Now it's time to add navigation to our app. Let's start with adding a new page where we could list _multiple_ color schemes as a list, and then navigate to a new page to view their details.

In order to achieve this, we will need a way to navigate between screens.

Navigation in React Native plays a crucial role in creating intuitive and seamless user experiences within mobile applications. React Native offers various navigation libraries and frameworks that simplify the process of building navigation flows. One popular choice is [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), which provides a flexible and extensible solution for handling navigation in React Native projects.

React Navigation offers a wide range of navigators, such as stack, tab, and drawer navigators, allowing developers to create navigation structures that suit their application's requirements. With stack navigation, screens are stacked on top of each other, enabling users to navigate back and forth through a hierarchical structure. Tab navigation organizes screens into tabs, perfect for apps with multiple distinct sections. Drawer navigation provides a side panel that slides in and out to reveal different screens or navigation options.

One of the key advantages of using React Navigation is its declarative approach to navigation configuration. Developers can define the navigation structure using a set of components and props, making it easy to understand and modify navigation flows. Additionally, React Navigation offers extensive customization options, allowing developers to style navigators, headers, and transitions to match the application's design.

React Navigation also provides a powerful navigation API that allows developers to programmatically navigate between screens, pass parameters, and handle navigation events. This API enables developers to build dynamic and interactive navigation experiences, such as deep linking, conditional navigation, and navigation-based animations.
