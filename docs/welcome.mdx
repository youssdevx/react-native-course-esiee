<b>Hi there, and welcome to React Native! 👋</b>

## 🎯 Course Objective

I build React Native apps for a living and my main goal today is to give you an idea on how I do it - what are the best practices, conventions, do's and dont's.

The aim of the course is to give you the knowledge and resources necessary to start building your own React Native project and create your first mobile app 📱

We will cover what React Native is, how it works, what kind of components and tooling are available, and how to use them. We will stick with built-in and mainstream components, and minimize the use of third party components and libraries.

## 📖 Course guide

The course is designed to be pretty hands-on: the general pattern is that we'll introduce a concept and then apply it.

- chapters marked with a 📝 emoji are exercises. How you approach them is up to you! If you generally learn best by doing, I'd recommend spending up to 10-15 minutes in completing the exercise independently before looking at the solution
- chapters marked with a 👀 emoji are the solutions to exercises
- make note of the link 🔗 emojis - these link to a GitHub repository that contains the solution to the code we just added - you can use this as a reference to check your work
- you will also occasionally see links with a 🔍 emoji - these are code examples in Expo Snack, there to help introduce or illustrate a concept. You can look at these in the browser (unless specified otherwise) or on your phone if you have the Expo app installed. Feel free to play around with them, your changes will not be saved to the hosted version

## 👉 About You

The intended audience for this course are people who are familiar with JavaScript, but new to React Native. This is why I'll teach you some JavaScript before learning React Native, using the best resources we can find online.

If you already know React, that's perfect, since your React skills are completely transferrable to React Native with only minor modifications to account for the native platform. However if you are new to both React and Native, never fear! I will be explaining all the React concepts as well as the React Native concepts as we discover them together, however there will be more of a focus on the parts of React Native that _differ_ from React on the web.

In this course, I will be using a MacBook Pro, an iPhone simulator and an Android emulator from Android Studio.

You do not need to match my setup, but you should have:

- either a Mac, Windows or Linux machine
- either a physical device (iPhone or Android) OR a simulator/emulator installed

Don't worry about the setup, I will explain everything you need to get you up and ready to create your first app in RN.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hi, my name is Youcef Acheuk and I am a freelance Senior Software Engineer, working currently with [Finary](https://finary.com/) where I build apps using React and React Native. 

I first got into coding in ESIEE where I studied Telecommunications. I never had the chance to learn JavaScript in a course at ESIEE but during several internships where I could develop web apps using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I learned JavaScript in 2010, I have been writing code professionally since 2014, using React and React Native since 2017.

As for social media, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youcefacheuk/).
